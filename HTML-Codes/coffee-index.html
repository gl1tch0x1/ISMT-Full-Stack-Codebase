    <h3>History of Coffee</h3>
    <p>Coffee has a rich history that dates back centuries. It is believed to have originated in Ethiopia, where legend
        has it that a goat herder named Kaldi discovered the energizing effects of coffee berries. The drink eventually
        made its way to the Arabian Peninsula, where it became a popular beverage among traders and travelers. In the
        17th century, coffeehouses emerged in Europe, serving as hubs for intellectual discourse and social gatherings.
        Today, coffee is enjoyed worldwide, with
        various brewing methods and flavors that cater to every palate.</p>
