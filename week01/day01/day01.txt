Variable: variable is a container which stores the value of same datatype.
    Types of variables used in js:
1. let
2. var 
3. const

1. let :
 * Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), let provides block-scoped variables. 
 * This means let variables are only accessible within the block 
      (e.g., if statements, for loops, or function blocks) where they are declared.
 * They can be updated, but not re-declared within the same scope.
   

2. var:
 * This is the oldest keyword for declaring variables.
 * var variables are function-scoped or globally-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the function 
    they are declared in, or they are accessible globally if declared outside any function.
 * They can be re-declared and updated.

3. const:
 * Also introduced in ES6, const is used to declare block-scoped constants.
 * Once a value is assigned to a const variable, it cannot be reassigned or re-declared.
 * It is important to note that for objects and arrays declared with const, 
    their contents can still be modified, but the variable itself cannot be pointed to a new object or array.

# Naming Rules for Variables:
 * Variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
 * Subsequent characters can be letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
 * Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different).
 * Reserved keywords (like function, class, return, if, else, etc.) cannot be used as variable names.
